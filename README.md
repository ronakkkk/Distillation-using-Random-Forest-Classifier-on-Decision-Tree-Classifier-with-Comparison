# Distillation-using-Random-Forest-Classifier-on-Decision-Tree-Classifier-with-Comparison
A descriptive analysis of three binary classification dataset and one continuous dataset, along with train and testing of the machine learning model are explained and compared. The machine learning model are Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier with distillation knowledge and without distillation knowledge are trained and tested. Distillation is performed on the target variable using Random Forest Classifier. The comparison is made using accuracy and performance of the model. The comparative studies clearly explain the distillation knowledge on target variable improve performance of the model if the target variable is in continuous form.
